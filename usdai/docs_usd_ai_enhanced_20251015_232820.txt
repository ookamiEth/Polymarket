# Welcome to USD.AI
Backed by the future

$
### USD.AI is a synthetic dollar protocol designed to finance the physical infrastructure of AI
Targeting 10-15% APR, it functions like a high-yield bond index tied to income-generating infrastructure equipment. Like most synthetic dollar protocols, the three key aspects of USD.AI are:

> USDai — a fully-backed synthetic dollarsUSDai — the yield-bearing token (counterpart to USDai)Yield — how the protocol generates yield for sUSDai

USDai or sUSDai are not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT

USDai is a low risk, fully-backed stablecoin, which allows it to be redeemed instantly at all times. USDai does not pass yield through to holders, instead providing users with deep secondary market liquidity across DeFi and CeFi.

sUSDai is the yield-bearing synthetic dollar backed by AI infrastructure assets.  These assets are inherently less liquid than stablecoins, so holders accrue yield for the added risk and are also subject to redemption periods.

Yield for sUSDai is generated through loans collateralized by AI infrastructure assets (GPUs). Depositors can earn yield without needing to underwrite or originate individual loans. Any idle capital is always held in Treasury Bills as a base yield and may include other low-risk stablecoins in the future.

Rather than simply offering loans, USD.AI restructures the very architecture of credit through the minting of a low-risk stablecoin (USDai) and the pricing of a yield-bearing derivative instrument (sUSDai)

# How USD.AI Works
Rewiring how "credit" works for GPU liquidity

$The USD.AI protocol revolves around three key participants:

> Depositors — earn yield on their USDC/USDT deposits by minting USDai and staking into sUSDaiBorrowers — typically non-hyperscaler infrastructure operators in need of hardware financingCurators —  provide the first-loss capital, earn associated premiums, and help separate the capital from the operator through tokenization

This structure is unique in that it separates capital from the operator (via CALIBER). Collateralized by the hardware itself, this risk is restructured into a standardized, investable format, much like how mortgage-backed products unlocked the scale of real estate finance. By transforming compute into a credit-ready asset class through this abstraction vehicle, USD.AI opens previously inaccessible capital for long-tail infrastructure, turning an overlooked use case into a new frontier for yield & tax optimization use cases.

The USD.AI protocol is designed around three pillars:

1. CALIBER — a framework for tokenization or Yield. Creating the ability to tokenize previously un-tokenizable assets
2. FiLo — a process for risk curation or Scale. Allowing future asset financing demand to be vetted and publicly funded
3. QEV — a system for liquidity or Redemption. Allowing fair and transparent access to liquidity

## Asset and Yield Makeup by Stage (Genesis to Sprawl)

### Why have 3 stages? It is because USD.AI is not a credit protocol.
"Credit" by definition examines the ability of a corporation or counterparty to pay down their loan. USD.AI does not extend loans to businesses or individuals — it provides liquidity to the asset itself. Much like how Aave does not underwrite the user, just the user's deposits. Example of transaction types excluded from USD.AI:

> Purchase order financing (supply chain loans)Business loans (revolving credit facilities, term loans)Capital leases (asset backed financing, but ownership is under the name of the borrower on their balance sheet)

As a result of the USD.AI collateralization processes, there is a natural lag in terms of when the asset is built by the Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") and when it is tokenized via CALIBER and ultimately financed through USD.AI.

This explains why we have a Stage 1 -> Stage 2. due to the design of CALIBER and the physical nature of hardware, there is a time delay. Solving the chicken and egg problem of doing a loan through the USDai protocol (this is why the AlloTM initiative has started)

During this lead time, the cash is held in US Treasury Bills to avoid cash drag, with the addition of AlloTM (Points) to help bridge the liquidity gap.  As a result there is no real "credit."

# InfraFi Market
InfraFi: Financing the Infrastructure Golden Age

$The primary trade in the emerging AI economy centers on financing the development of infrastructure and the enormous capital expenditures required over the next few years. Currently, this financing is dominated by tradfi yield-based products such as loans, bonds, and convertible preferred equity.

Elon Musk has underscored the critical gap in financing for these projects, estimating a $490 billion shortfall in capital vs the announced $500bn for Stargate. This gap represents a monumental opportunity for new players to emerge, including crypto participants. USD.AI is uniquely positioned to address this challenge by providing a financial layer tailored to the AI supercycle. Much like how Tether leveraged its role in stablecoin markets to become one of the largest holders of U.S. Treasury securities or how Bitcoin mining debt scaled to $20-50bn with niche hardware collateral, USD.AI may evolve into a dominant participant in the Golden Age of AI infrastructure by bridging the intersection of crypto, DeFi structuring, and hardware.

Tether: Became one of the largest holders of U.S. Treasuries by leveraging its dominance in stablecoins.

Bitcoin Mining: Established one of the largest crypto-related debt markets, with $20–50 billion in financing, entirely related to niche hardware

USD.AI: Combines both strategies, aiming to become a leading supporter of AI infrastructure by bridging the gap between crypto-native liquidity, DeFi structuring, and hardware underwriting.

## RWAs tokenizes the past. We should use onchain protocols to solve for the capex-heavy industries of the future.
RWAs have largely failed as a category for nearly a decade outside of riskless T-bill adoption. Most attempts at tokenizing real-world assets have focused on assets that are already well-collateralized and have access to robust capital markets. These tokenization efforts lack a compelling reason to move on-chain, except for adverse selection: projects or borrowers that struggle to secure traditional financing often turn to these platforms. One can view the challenges faced by many established web3 protocols, but even web2 platforms such as YieldStreet and Lending Club - these platforms have faced tremendous adverse selection when competing with traditional debt capital markets.

Contrast this with crypto-native assets, underpinned by crypto-native revenue. These assets borrow on-chain for a clear reason: traditional banks would never issue loans based on on-chain cash flows. This creates the opposite dynamic. On-chain private credit, properly designed, serves strong on-chain cash flows that lack off-chain financing options, flipping the adverse selection critique. The challenge lies in structuring the market to ensure robust collateralization and risk management while avoiding the pitfalls seen in other RWA initiatives.

## USD.AI: The "petrodollar" for the AGI future
The evolution of cryptocurrency is deeply tied to the story of hardware. By 2010, miners turned to GPUs for greater processing power amid competition. The real shift came in 2013 with the introduction of ASICs—hardware built specifically for mining—which transformed Bitcoin mining into a large-scale, capital-driven industry. This period saw the rise of industrial mining operations and significant investments from institutions, setting the stage for Bitcoin’s growth into a network worth trillions today.

Bitcoin’s rapid acceleration was underpinned by its ability to tap into global debt markets, often overlooked but critical to scaling the hardware ecosystem. ASIC manufacturers and large mining operators needed substantial upfront capital to produce and deploy cutting-edge machines. Companies like 21.co attempted to capitalize on this demand early on but struggled due to poor structuring (Permian Labs’ CTO, Ivan Sergeev, saw this happen live.) Their challenges highlighted the complexity of aligning hardware financing with operational scalability, eventually leading to the company’s pivot under Balaji Srinivasan and Lily Liu. His experience with Bitcoin fueled his concept for the Network State, where the unit of a “node” is the original economically productive unit. Physical nodes are hardware, and hardware scales with capital markets.

Bitcoin’s success shows how hardware and access to capital fuel each other. Before DeFi existed, Bitcoin relied on international debt markets to expand its infrastructure, stunting its expediency due to sluggish traditional processes. The network’s value grew because it could secure the physical resources—the chips—needed to operate and scale.

Now consider the rise of AGI. If it happens, AGI will depend on its infrastructure to survive and grow. It will also need a currency tied to that infrastructure, much like the U.S. dollar and the petrodollar linked oil to economic dominance in the 1970s. Such a currency wouldn’t be human-made in the traditional sense. It would arise out of necessity, built to secure the systems that AGI relies on. That currency is USD.AI.

DePIN—Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks—can follow a similar path. These projects need hardware and liquidity to scale, but they’re constrained by access to resources. USD.AI makes it possible to unlock growth by letting infrastructure owners borrow against their assets to invest in more infrastructure, stacking yield on yield. This is the same financial loop that powered Bitcoin’s rise, adapted for physical networks.

The question isn’t whether a currency like USD.AI will emerge. It’s whether it will arrive in time to meet the demands of AI, crypto, and the next generation of decentralized infrastructure. USD.AI isn’t a speculative idea. It’s the next step.

# Stackable DeFi Primitives
Stackable DeFi Primitives Unlock a New Liquidity Layer

$
#### “Structured Finance” is the process of abstraction: utilizing layers of liquidity mechanisms to achieve full risk transfer, like thermal dynamics but for finance, only achievable on-chain through stackable, composable DeFi primitives. USD.AI and the corresponding token representations (USDai and sUSDai) represent the latest progression of the legacy MetaStreet architecture & ecosystem around on-chain structured credit products.
Given the nature of capital market assets (low mark-to-market), USD.AI rebuilds the entire DeFi stack to be oracleless & made for capital assets rather than just money assets (spot market & oracle-based) designed around three pillars:

1. CALIBER — a framework for tokenization or Yield. Creating the ability to tokenize previously un-tokenizable assets
2. FiLo — a process for risk curation or Scale. Allowing future asset financing demand to be vetted and publicly funded
3. QEV — a system for liquidity or Redemption. Allowing fair and transparent access to liquidity

Below is a detailed timeline and evolution of these stackable DeFi Primitives:

### Lending Without Price Oracles → CALIBER

• Automatic Tranche Maker or "ATM" (like Uniswap v3 for oracleless swaps) enables oracleless lending for low-liquidity assets (NFTs, RWAs, etc)
• Launched in 2023, reached $3mm TVL

### Long-dated, Yield-Bearing Loans → QEV

• Liquid Credit Token or "LCT" (similar to Lido) enables trading of yield-bearing tranche positions, “rebases” upon loan repayments
• Launched in 2024, reached $60mm TVL

### Modular Underwriting (RWA Asset Origination) → CALIBER & FiLo

• ObjectSDK (comparable to Morpho Blue for DePIN/RWAs) enables modular underwriting system for low latency appraisals & amortization schedules
• Launched in 2024, enabled 20 new assets

### Yield Splitting Without Spot LP → CALIBER

• Yield Pass (similar to Pendle but for NFTs) strips & isolates yields but for productive illiquid assets, such as Node Licenses
• Launched in 2024, reached $202mm TVL

### USD.AI Synthetic Dollar for Unified Liquidity Layer (CALIBER & FiLo)

• USD.AI (like “GLP/HLP” - a single token for multiple collateral types) is a yield-bearing synthetic dollar backed by loans against AI hardware (InfraFi)Targeting 10-15% APR, but initially starting as a T-Bill yield-bearing product with plans to progressively diversify collateral base to InfraFi assets
• Launched in 2025, current TVL can be viewed at https://app.usd.ai/dashboard

### Queue Extractable Value (QEV) to Optimize Redemption Liquidity

• QEV-Boost – a liquidity incentive system based on epoch timing (similar to Flashbots) that improves USD.AI liquidity allocation through market-driven queue orderingStructured redemption queue based on payment schedulesStakers can bid in QEV auctions for priority access to liquidityFair distribution through proportional queue advancementPassive stakers earn rewards from smoothed yields and auction fees
• Target: Enhance redemption efficiency to earn up to 3% of protocol yield via QEV prioritization

1. Solution Overview

# 1. CALIBER [Yield]
CALIBER is a framework for off-balance sheet tokenization, a superior version of "RWAs"

$
## CALIBER: A Scalable Collateralization Registry System for DeFi (UCC Section 7)
Outside of T-bill products, existing RWA tokenization models struggle with tokenizing physical assets: they often have weak enforcement, making liquidation and risk management inefficient and often catastrophic for crypto-native participants.

USD.AI introduces CALIBER (Collateralized Asset Ledger: Insurance, Bailment, Evaluation, and Redemption) a new offchain-onchain framework utilizing Uniform Commercial Code (UCC Section 7). It is designed to enable direct asset tokenization, enforceable redemption, and integrated insurance for GPU hardware. As DeFi matures beyond money markets into capital markets, CALIBER ensures structured but uncompromised growth for USD.AI.

Due to the parameters around UCC 7, all representations must be in 1:1 form and therefore in an ERC-721 or equivalent format. ERC-20 representations, while more liquid, have elevated risk levels resulting from poor fractionalization designs, which can trigger securities laws and introduce complexities around asset redemptions.

CALIBER is a generalized framework for any offchain, hard asset(s)

CALIBER was initially designed to enforce on-chain ownership and financial structuring for AI hardware. However, the framework extends beyond these categories, providing a standardized model for any off-chain asset representation.

By integrating enforceable ownership, embedded insurance, and instant redemption, CALIBER establishes a new benchmark for tokenized real-world assets. We invite protocols across industries, such as real estate, commodities, and hard assets, to adopt CALIBER as the foundation for secure, asset-backed tokenization before its full integration into on-chain structured product protocols.

DeFi’s future is not bringing structured products on-chain. It’s bringing the assets’ representations on-chain and leveraging DeFi’s financial engineering and derivative issuance capabilities. The real opportunity lies in using smart contracts to create programmable, composable, and liquid financial layers that extend beyond traditional structured finance, unlocking new markets and yield dynamics that are impossible in legacy systems. This starts with proper and robust tokenization of real assets, not their already-structured synthetic representations.

## Key Parties
Borrower: Owns GPUs via Bankruptcy Remote Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)

Tokenizing Agent: Legal entity that tokenizes GPUs to enable onchain loan execution. Currently, Permian Labs is the only approved Tokenizing Agent for USD.AI GPU loans.

Datacenter: The warehouse owner that custodies the GPUs (providing the power, water, internet connectivity and security that enable the use of the Borrower's GPUs).

Lender: The capital provider lending funds to Borrower, sUSDai holder.

## Flow of Funds

### Tokenization via Bailment
In order obtain financing, the Borrower must first contribute their GPUs to a bankruptcy remote SPV that is a wholly owned subsidiary entity managed by an independent manager (who exists solely to ensure bankruptcy remoteness). This structure ensures that if the Borrower goes bankrupt, the GPUs are kept outside of claim from any other creditors of the Borrower.

After contribution, the SPV signs a Bailment Agreement with the Datacenter that is warehousing the SPVs. The Bailment serves to create legally enforceable "Electronic Documents of Title", pursuant to Article 7 and Article 12 of the Uniform Commercial Code (represented with an ERC-721 NFT). The Bailment names the Datacenter as Bailee and the holder of the Electronic Document of Title as Bailor. Permian Labs serves as Tokenizing Agent for the transaction, minting the NFTs on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to terms outlined in a services agreement. This establishes digital property rights, enabling the Borrower to post collateral digitally in order to borrow funds against their GPUs while maintaining all normal business operations (signing colocation agreements with datacenters, rental agreements with compute customers, etc) without any disruption.

### Loan Execution
Once the GPU has been tokenized, the Borrower is free to borrow directly from the USD.AI Protocol, using their Electronic Document of Title NFT as collateral. To execute the transaction, the Borrower posts their NFT collateral into the pool, withdrawing their loan in USDC. Then, the Borrower makes payments every 30 days to keep their loan current, according to the terms above (mid teens APR, 3 year principal amortization).

### In the Event of Default
If Borrower fails to meet their loan payment requirements, (ie, interest & principal payment every 30 days, with one 30 day grace period at an accelerated APR), the Borrower would trigger an event of default. This will cause the NFT, which retains all rights to the underlying GPU, to be sold via auction. The new buyer of the GPU can then step into the Bailment Agreement between the Datacenter and Borrower, and reclaim the underlying asset for their own purposes or establish a new agreement with the Datacenter to continue warehousing the GPUs.

### In the Event of Borrower Bankruptcy
If the Borrower parent goes bankrupt, the assets backing the loan are completely walled off from other creditors. The SPV has full separation from the Borrower and cannot be collpased back into the Borrower for other creditors to try to claim the tokenized GPUs as part of the bankruptcy process.

1. Solution Overview

# 2. FiLo Curator [Scale]
First Loss Curators help scale USD.AI by originating and legitimizing loans for the protocol

$
## First Loss Curation Model
Inspired by Morpho’s modular curator model, USD.AI advances this by requiring curators to take a first-loss position in exchange for higher yield. These positions are illiquid and do not share the same benefits as the more liquid USDai & sUSDai tranches.

In other, words the "FiLo Curator" takes significantly more risk, often originates the loan, undergoes protocol governance for onboarding, and is the core risk alignment design that scales the curation & origination of the yields, while USDai takes care of the structuring and distribution.

This model ensures USD.AI can onboard loans quickly to scale, while also ensuring depositors and stakers are protected from underwriting risk

## Underwriting Process and Standards
Underwriting Hierarchy (most stringent to least):

1. Onboarding a new underwriter
2. Onboarding a new industry vertical
3. Onboarding a new asset type (e.g., Rockchip vs B200)
4. First-time borrower (requires insurance structuring and bailment design)
5. Repeat loans to onboarded borrowers (can happen overnight)

The CALIBER tokenization framework accelerates steps 3–5 by ensuring bankruptcy remoteness and clear asset tokenization. Every deal must include a first-loss tranche to align incentives and risk exposure. We plan for a controlled rollout: a small group of participants at launch, expanding as live deal data validates the infrastructure.

USD.AI never extends credit to any business as a counterparty — only to the collateral itself.

## Collateral Overview & Market Context
Unlike bitcoin mining rigs, which are highly exposed to commodity pricing and electricity costs, AI GPUs benefit from diverse global demand — sovereign AI infrastructure, foundation model training, cloud inference, HPC workloads, and leasing data centers. This broad resale and redeployment optionality reduces systemic price collapse risk.

Why BTC rigs are riskier:

• Dislocation of equipment (single use cases, difficult to transport)
• Extremely high revenue concentration (convexity to bitcoin price)
• Dependency on input prices (energy costs)

By contrast, AI hardware serves multiple global industries and sovereign infrastructure demand, making its resale market deeper and more resilient to shocks.

## Collateral Risk Management Safeguards
Aggressive Amortization

> The primary safeguard is an aggressive amortization schedule, which front-loads principal repayments to reduce exposure regardless of short-term FMV swings. While industry estimates suggest 5–7 year economic lives for top-tier GPUs (NVIDIA: 7, CoreWeave: 5), USD.AI underwriters use a more conservative 3-year depreciation curve. For example, an LTV that starts at 70% could drop to ~40% after one year.

Waterfall Capital Stack

> Each loan uses a layered capital stack:Equity cushion from the borrowerFirst-loss tranche from the underwriterRapid principal amortizationThis ensures that any valuation shocks or downturns are absorbed by the borrower and curator before they affect sUSDai holders. The rigid CMBS-like terms mean that missed payments immediately trigger forfeiture and recovery, adding further protection.

3rd Party Appraisals

> Secondary market pricing is sourced from independent providers, including Evertas and Blockware. Additionally, the semi-fungibility of top-tier GPUs (e.g., B200, GB200) allows for standardization in valuation and risk modeling across asset classes, as these are rolling out of the factories at this moment in time (we also have the valuation calibrated via Evertas’s continuous valuation checks). Live pricing is a core feature of DeFi, but is not tenable in physical assets - which is why we originally built an oracleless NFT lending in the first place.

There are no oracles — aggressive amortization schedules, underwriters, and independent appraisals protect the protocol from collateral pricing risk

Example showcase loans:

• TACOM borrow with RK3588s ($600k across two loans)
• Lyceum Technologies amortization schedule ($2.6m loan)

## Other Risk Management Safeguards
Operational Role

> USD.AI is never the operator of the underlying hardware. It acts solely as a bailor, with ownership structured via CALIBER but operations externalized to borrowers — eliminating asset servicing risk during the loan term.

Hardware Age

> Most loans are with newly installed hardware. Assets are largely semifungible, so LTVs are adjusted linearly as hardware ages. Durations always target the shorter range versus market norms to reduce exposure.

30 Day Refinancing Windows

> In line with market standards, there are no liquidations on the borrower side, but only defaults. 30-day refinancing windows means hardware value would have to drop by ~40% in that window to trigger an economic default. Even then, the protocol’s pessimistic assumptions (NVIDIA’s 7-year lifespan vs. our 3-year amortization) provide an additional margin of safety. Depositors should be comfortable with this conservative risk modeling — similar to how Ethena depositors accept possible negative rebasing if the basis collapses.

Rigid CMBS-Like Logic

> Like the CMBS market, USD.AI operates on rigid terms: miss a payment, forfeit the asset. This unforgiving structure is essential for scaling a deep and liquid credit market.

While amortization, FiLo and appraisals are the most important protection for the protocol, these additional safeguards provide an additional layer for USD.AI participants

## Default Enforcement & Recovery
In the event of borrower default, collateral is routed through two steps:

1. A 30-day refinancing grace period
2. Then a 7-day auction

> Recovery is fully automated via smart contracts — no governance or discretionary intervention. This way the sUSDai holders never hold the asset on the books, it is always placed into default and cashed up instantly.

Auction Process

> We are actively onboarding hardware partners who can assist in recycling collateral for redeployment (this has been the easiest way to get buy-in from industry participants). Often times, the underwriter will provide the stalking horse bid in majority of these defaults.

# 3. QEV [Redeem]
Queue Extractable Value is a novel DeFi Primitive for Long-Dated Redemptions and Low-Liquidity Collateral

$
## Introduction to Queue Extractable Value (QEV)
QEV is a DeFi primitive designed to address liquidity challenges associated with long-dated redemptions and low-liquidity collateral within the USD.AI protocol. By introducing a market-driven mechanism for pricing and sequencing redemptions, QEV enables depositors to access liquidity more efficiently while mitigating the risks of illiquid assets and extended lockup periods. This section provides an in-depth explanation of QEV’s purpose, mechanics, and implementation within USD.AI, focusing on its role in optimizing capital efficiency for amortizing assets such as Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) and AI hardware loans.

## Motivation and Background
In traditional DeFi systems, liquidity is often assumed to be readily available through automated market makers (AMMs) or secondary markets. However, assets with long maturities or low liquidity—such as tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), fixed-income instruments, or DePIN collateral—present unique challenges. Rigid redemption mechanisms can lead to liquidity mismatches, forcing participants into disorderly exits via secondary markets at steep discounts, as observed in events like the USDO++ depeg. These mismatches echo historical financial crises, such as the 2023 regional banking crisis, where liquidity constraints, rather than asset quality, precipitated systemic instability.

The USD.AI protocol addresses these issues by integrating QEV as a core mechanism to dynamically price liquidity and manage redemption queues. QEV is inspired by Flashbots’ MEV-Boost (or proposer-builder separation) design. Just as Flashbots abstracted away MEV extraction from miners and validators by introducing a structured market for transaction inclusion, QEV applies the same principle to redemption sequencing in loan repayments for amortizing assets.

Instead of treating liquidity constraints as a passive problem, QEV pre-solves the issue by embedding an auction-based prioritization mechanism directly into the system at launch, integrating it seamlessly into the cash flow & loan repayment stream. A transparent and demand-driven market determines queue positioning, preventing opaque or unfair liquidity bottlenecks.

Passive stakers also benefit, as queue priority is priced into an open auction model rather than being dictated by rigid withdrawal rules. This makes liquidity access more flexible and market-efficient, while still maintaining predictable “amortization” epoch schedules.

By defining Queue Extractable Value as an expected problem to solve for, QEV aligns liquidity optimization with the native constraints of long-maturity/amortizing assets, ensuring structured, scalable and frictionless capital deployment & withdrawal.

## Mechanism Design

### Amortization as "block production"
QEV relies on a structured liquidity scheduling system for yield-bearing assets with predefined repayment cycles, operating in a synchronous manner similar to how blockchains process transactions at each block. Liquidity is released in scheduled increments, ensuring controlled capital flow and sustainable redemptions. This structured unlocking follows predefined amortization schedules, providing a predictable framework for liquidity distribution, ensuring:

• Predictable liquidity distribution, preventing sudden supply shocks.
• Queue-based sequencing, similar to epoch-based unlocking in PoS staking systems.
• Capital commitment enforcement, reducing speculative volatility and premature exits

Amortization is a result of various protocol mechanics to empower the borrower while protecting the lender, but there are two mechanisms that enable the situation:

1. Lumping streaming yield distributions from long-dated yields (T-bills, veCRV, etc): primarily relates to riskless yield assets like T-bills or zero-coupon loans or any naturally yield streaming asset.
2. Principal repayment (all other loans): representing the majority of “RWA” loans, these loans naturally amortize through monthly repayments. USD.AI has monthly rollovers of 30-day zero-coupon loans to mimic a “perpetual fixed income loan” but with loan amortization increasing the size of the cash-up events / size of each auction.

Synchronous blind bid auction maturity + asynchronous borrow repayments

Given the asynchronous nature of borrower/lender liquidity patterns, QEV is synchronized to every 30 days to sum all the distributions until the next auction as there is clear visibility on repayment patterns every forward 30 days:

Example of auctions given repayment visibility:

Jan 1: First auction for ($250 liquidity)

Jan 2: Borrower A repays $100 (last) +

Jan 4: Borrower C starts new loan

Jan 15: Borrower B repays $150

Feb 1: Second auction ($170 liquidity)

Feb 4: Borrower C repays $20 (first) +

Feb 15: Borrower B repays $150

### The Redemption Queue as a Market
Each epoch presents a limited supply of liquidity for redemption. As demand for exits fluctuates, a natural competition for queue positioning emerges. Instead of an inefficient first-come-first-served system, QEV structures priority access based on market-driven pricing.

• Queue positions become market-based mechanism, allowing users to bid for faster redemptions.
• A secondary market for liquidity sequencing ensures fair, transparent capital allocation.
• Demand-based pricing for redemptions optimizes efficiency in amortizing asset withdrawals.
• If no one bids, the queue enters into a FIFO distribution should anyone enter redeem. If no one redeems, all proceeds are rolled over to potentially new loans or stay in T-bills (”basic redemption / reinvests”).

### QEV zkAuctions: Market-Driven Liquidity Unlocks
Rather than rigid queue lockups, QEV enables structured priority bidding through epoch-based auctions.

1. Stakers enter a redemption queue, receiving amortized liquidity over time.
2. Users bid for priority access to unlock liquidity faster.Bids scale queue movement proportionally, avoiding all-or-nothing distribution situations.Passive stakers receive rewards through bribe redistribution.All bids are done privately via zero-knowledge proofs to avoid MEV for QEV scenarios (last block bids)
3. Winning bidders move up in the queue, while non-bidders remain in amortized scheduling.

### QEV-Boost & QEV-smoothening: Structured Liquidity Optimization
Queue extractable value is inspired by Flashbots' approach to Miner Extractable Value (MEV), particularly the way MEV-Boost and smoothing mechanisms optimize transaction inclusion. Just as Flashbots introduced structured auction markets for MEV extraction, QEV brings a similar structured approach to redemption sequencing in long-dated assets.

#### QEV-Boost vs. MEV-Boost (aka. Blind Bid Auction)

• MEV-Boost (Flashbots): Enables market-driven block building, where validators can extract MEV while optimizing inclusion fairness.
• QEV-Boost (USD.AI): Enables market-driven redemption sequencing, allowing users to bid for priority in liquidity exits.

#### QEV-Smoothing vs. MEV-Smoothing (aka. whale mgmt)

• MEV-Smoothing (Flashbots): Distributes extracted MEV across validators to prevent centralization and unfair advantages.
• QEV-Smoothing (USD.AI): Redistributes liquidity access based on bids to prevent whale dominance, ensuring fair allocation.

By applying the structured auction principles of MEV-Boost, QEV ensures that liquidity allocation in long-dated assets follows an open, transparent market process rather than arbitrary or rigid redemption rules.

QEV-smoothening is solve through Allocated Liquidity: the portion of available liquidity (Δ₁) distributed to depositors based on their bid strength relative to total bids.

Allocated Liquidity=(Absolute Bid∑Absolute Bids)×Δ1\text{Allocated Liquidity} = \left( \frac{\text{Absolute Bid}}{\sum \text{Absolute Bids}} \right) \times \Delta_1Allocated Liquidity=(∑Absolute BidsAbsolute Bid​)×Δ1​[NOTE] This formula may be subject to governance updates as depositor and borrower behaviors evolve. All formulas involve trade-offs between:

• Managing small vs. large depositor interests.

• Ensuring borrowers’ liquidity needs align with depositor expectations.

The smart contracts are modular and allow onchain formula swapping via droplets, ensuring governance can optimize liquidity dynamics over time.

To prevent inefficiencies, QEV-Boost introduces an optimized auction layer for queue positioning:

• Private matching: Ensures fair, efficient queue bidding execution.Given the privacy, bidders can bid at anytime for the full 30 days leading up to the next auction. The only data visibility will be the # of bidding participants relative to the # of total depositors.
• Proportional Queue Movement: Adjusts positions dynamically rather than granting full priority to the highest bidder.
• Protocol yield source: The protocol earns from these “queue bribes” or auction bids, while reducing forced early exits and volatility.

### Example Scenarios
The following two diagrams are illustrations of redemption queue processes with Alice, Bob and Charlie with different deposit values & different bids. Once their priority is placed, their redemption values are calculated in proportion to their priority through the smoothening formula.

What if someone doesn’t bid into their redemption request, while other participants have? If a depositor bids 0, their absolute bid is 0, meaning:

0∑Absolute Bids×Δ1=0\frac{0}{\sum \text{Absolute Bids}} \times \Delta_1 = 0∑Absolute Bids0​×Δ1​=0Here are two different amortization scenarios with different liquidity totals ($100k vs $250k) but the same deposit values ($950k TVL):

• Example 1 (Δ = $100,000):The largest depositor (Alice) minimally participates with a very low value bid.
• Example 2 (Δ = $250,000): The largest depositor (Alice) bids the highest absolute bid.

### Economic Implications

#### Market-Driven Queue Optimization
By transforming queue sequencing into a liquidity market, QEV unlocks new financial primitives:

• Liquidity as a tradable asset → Queue positions can be priced, exchanged and eventually tokenized
• Dynamic pricing of redemption slots → Demand-sensitive capital allocation
• Arbitrage opportunities for strategic bidders → Optimized exit strategies create new yield mechanics

#### Stability & Peg Enforcement
While assets that depend on QEV-adjusted is not designed to as a traditional stablecoin (backed by fully liquid assets), it prioritizes using market-based mechanisms to calibrate lower-liquidity repayment schedules into a 1:1 liquid asset with a clear path toward re-pegging based on monetizable redemption traffic (hence “synthetic dollar”).

Structured amortization schedules & queue sequencing improve liquidity stability:

• Prevents mass liquidity shocks.
• Reduces volatility in redemption pricing.
• Minimizes systemic risk from capital flight.

In addition to instant auctions, collateral guarantees and token + cash insurance fund, QEV will be the core dampener of volatility for USD.AI depegging.

#### Digesting data for rapid decision making
The user interface will be similar to gas costs exposed in the UI in EVM wallets, including data streams of previous performances such as “QEV gas” UI charts over time.

A simple 3-tiered module could appear as:

## Summary
Queue Extractable Value (QEV) represents a necessary evolution in DeFi liquidity design. It treats redemption liquidity as an auction-based resource rather than a fixed discount function, ensuring that exits are dynamically priced according to real-time liquidity availability. Instead of relying on reactive interventions, QEV enables liquidity providers to be compensated based on queue depth, automatically adjusting incentives in response to redemption demand. This prevents reflexive depegging, ensures fair pricing, and eliminates the need for unsustainable liquidity incentives. Unlike utilization-based models, which work for short-term money markets but fail for fixed-duration assets, QEV directly prices liquidity at the protocol level, making redemptions predictable, fair, and resistant to shock events.

If low-liquidity crypto assets were to scale into DeFi capital markets & form factors, they must move beyond static liquidity assumptions and adopt market-driven mechanisms that dynamically price exit liquidity under all conditions.

# Technical Protocol Overview
$
### USDai
USDai is an $M-backed stablecoin. It is primarily used as the on and off ramp to Staked USDai (sUSDai), but may offer other incentives in the future.

#### Minting
Users can mint USDai by depositing a supported stablecoin (e.g. USDC, USDT), which is swapped internally for M.

Copy
```
/**
 * @notice Deposit
 * @param depositToken Deposit token
 * @param depositAmount Deposit amount
 * @param usdaiAmountMinimum Minimum USDai amount
 * @param recipient Recipient
 * @param data Data (for swap adapter)
 * @return USDai amount
 */
function deposit(
    address depositToken,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 usdaiAmountMinimum,
    address recipient,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (uint256);
```

#### Burning
Users can burn USDai and withdraw a supported stablecoin.

$Copy
```
/**
 * @notice Withdraw
 * @param withdrawToken Withdraw token
 * @param usdaiAmount USD amount
 * @param withdrawAmountMinimum Withdraw amount minimum
 * @param recipient Recipient
 * @param data Data (for swap adapter)
 * @return Withdraw amount
 */
function withdraw(
    address withdrawToken,
    uint256 usdaiAmount,
    uint256 withdrawAmountMinimum,
    address recipient,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (uint256);
```

/$
#### Swap Adapters
Swap adapters are responsible for swapping in and out of M with supported currencies. Currently, the default swap adapter is the UniswapV3SwapAdapter. Swap adapters accept optional data to help facilitate swapping. In the case of the UniswapV3SwapAdapter, the optional data specifies a path for the swap router to swap tokens that do not have a direct swap market with M.

### sUSDai
Staked USDai (sUSDai) is a yield bearing ERC4626 (ERC7540 redeem) vault token that earns yield from USDai M emissions and MetaStreet Pool loans. USDai can be staked for sUSDai, and later redeemed back for USDai. Unlike USDai, sUSDai is not a stablecoin, but a free floating token, representing shares in an assortment of targeted lending positions and unallocated USDai.

#### Staking
Users can stake USDai to receive sUSDai at the current deposit share price. Staking is a synchronous ERC4626 deposit operation.

$Copy
```
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) external returns (uint256 shares);
function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) external returns (uint256 assets);
```

/$Overloads for deposit() and mint() are provided with slippage protections for EOAs.

#### Unstaking
Users can unstake sUSDai to receive USDai at the current redemption share price. Unstaking is an asynchronous ERC7540 redeem operation. Redemptions are subject to a timelock (e.g. 7 days).

$Copy
```
function requestRedeem(uint256 shares, address controller, address owner) external returns (uint256 requestId);
function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) external returns (uint256 assets);
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) external returns (uint256 shares);
```

/$
#### Position Managers
The underlying asset held by the sUSDai vault is USDai, which is deployed and harvested for yield with position managers. The BasePositionManager is responsible for harvesting M emissions for the M held in the USDai contract. The PoolPositionManager is responsible for depositing and withdrawing from MetaStreet pools.

The STRATEGY_ADMIN_ROLE is required for harvesting yield and allocating the USDai asset to and from pools. Currently, these operations are scheduled offchain and executed by a multisig, but in the future will be an onchain strategy with governance-driven parameters.

#### Admin Fee
Admin fees are collected from loan repayments, as a fixed percentage of the total interest of the loan. Only successfully repaid loans contribute admin fees. In the case of a defaulted loan, the admin fee is used to offset liquidation losses.

Admin fees are set to 10% for the time being. They can be managed through a governance process in the future to accrue fees to the protocol.

$Copy
```
/**
 * @notice Harvest yield from base token
 * @param usdaiAmount USDai amount
 */
function harvestBaseYield(
    uint256 usdaiAmount
) external;
```

/$$Copy
```
/**
 * @notice Deposit assets into a pool
 * @param pool Address of the pool
 * @param tick Pool tick
 * @param usdaiAmount Amount of USDai to deposit
 * @param poolCurrencyAmountMinimum Minimum amount of pool currency to deposit
 * @param minShares Minimum shares expected
 * @param data Data (for swap adapter)
 * @return shares Amount of shares received
 */
function poolDeposit(
    address pool,
    uint128 tick,
    uint256 usdaiAmount,
    uint256 poolCurrencyAmountMinimum,
    uint256 minShares,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (uint256 shares);
```

/$$Copy
```
/**
 * @notice Withdraw assets from a pool after redemption
 * @param pool Address of the pool
 * @param tick Pool tick
 * @param redemptionId ID of the redemption
 * @param poolCurrencyAmountMaximum Maximum amount of pool currency to withdraw
 * @param usdaiAmountMinimum Minimum amount of USDai to withdraw
 * @param data Data (for swap adapter)
 * @return USDai amount
 */
function poolWithdraw(
    address pool,
    uint128 tick,
    uint128 redemptionId,
    uint256 poolCurrencyAmountMaximum,
    uint256 usdaiAmountMinimum,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (uint256);
```

/$
#### Share Pricing
The net asset value of sUSDai is the combined value of unallocated USDai and the value of its lending pool debt positions. Lending pool debt positions are not guaranteed, as loans may default, so their value can be estimated conservatively (in the case of default and liquidation), or optimistically (in the case of repayment). Loans are assumed to be overcollateralized, so a conservative estimate only includes the principal of loans, while an optimistic estimate includes the principal plus real-time accrued interest of loans. As loans are repaid, the interest is realized and compounded into the principal of newly originated loans.

The deposit share price is computed from the optimistic net asset value, while the redemption share price is computed from the conservative net asset value. In general, the deposit share price is greater than or equal to the redemption share price. If there are no active lending positions, they are equal.

Since the net asset value is denominated in USDai (backed by M), a price oracle is needed to convert the lending pool position value, denominated in the pool currency, back to USDai. IPriceOracle provides this interface. The current implementation, ChainlinkPriceOracle, uses Chainlink to price the exchange rate of the lending pool currencies.

$Copy
```
/**
 * @notice Check if token is supported
 * @param token Token
 * @return True if token is supported, false otherwise
 */
function supportedToken(
    address token
) external view returns (bool);

/**
 * @notice Get price of token in terms of USDai
 * @param token Token
 */
function price(
    address token
) external view returns (uint256);
```

/$
#### Redemption Queue
Redemptions in sUSDai are managed with a FIFO queue, subject to a timelock (e.g. 7 days). In the future, the redemption queue will implement a built-in auction to bid on queue position.

Redemptions are serviced periodically by the STRATEGY_ADMIN_ROLE, as lending positions may need to be unwound to provide sufficient USDai. This is currently scheduled offchain to optimize for latency and capital distribution across the lending pools. Once sufficient USDai is available, the strategy may call serviceRedemptions() to process redemptions in the queue.

$Copy
```
/**
 * @notice Service pending redemption requests
 * @param shares Shares to process
 * @return Amount processed
 */
function serviceRedemptions(
    uint256 shares
) external returns (uint256);
```

/$
### Omnichain Support
USDai and sUSDai support burn()/mint()-style omnichain token transfers. This interface requires the BRIDGE_ADMIN_ROLE, which is granted to the token messaging contract.

Support for LayerZero is available with OAdapter, which implements the messaging endpoint, and the OToken, which implements an ERC20 of the bridged representation.

## 6. No Warranty and Disclaimers; Assumption of the Risk

### 6.1 No Warranty and Disclaimers
The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Use of the Service is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from USD.AI or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, USD.AI, its subsidiaries, its affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable or correct; that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or your use of the Service.

Further, USD.AI does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service, and USD.AI will not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between you and third-party providers of products or services.

Federal law, some states, provinces and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. These Terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under these Terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

To the fullest extent permitted by law and notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms or any other agreement contemplated herein or applicable provisions of law or equity or otherwise, the parties hereto agree to eliminate any and all fiduciary duties USD.AI or any related entities and agents may have to you, or your agents and affiliates, or the users of the Service, provided that such exclusion or limitation of liability shall not extend to misappropriation of your assets or funds or content provided by USD.AI or any related entities and agents or other acts or omissions that constitute a bad faith violation of the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

### 6.2 Assumption of the Risk
By utilizing the Service or interacting with the USD.AI Content in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage, intricacies, and difficulties of using native cryptographic tokens, such as Ether (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), smart contract based-tokens such as those that follow the Ethereum Token Standard (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20), and blockchain-based software systems. In general, the underlying software for blockchain networks is open source such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that (i) USD.AI or any related entities are not responsible for operation of the underlying software and networks that there exists no guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software and networks; (ii) the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as “Forks”), and that such Forks may materially affect the Service; and (iii) you hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against us, our affiliates and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to any of the risks set forth in these Terms. USD.AI may decide, in its sole discretion, not to support (or cease supporting) the Forked network entirely. You acknowledge and agree that USD.AI assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of any underlying software protocols, whether Forked or not.

The Service could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of USD.AI to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Service, including access to your funds.

You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Service or USD.AI Content, which could result in the theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property. To the extent possible, it is intended to update the protocol underlying the Service to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but does not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of the system. By using the Service or accessing USD.AI Content, you acknowledge these inherent risks.

You understand that blockchain technologies and associated currencies or tokens are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the relevant blockchain. You acknowledge these risks and represent that USD.AI or any related entity or person cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.

Although the Service is intended to provide accurate and timely information on the Service and other tools making up the Service, the Service (including, without limitation, the USD.AI Content) or relevant tools may not always be entirely accurate, complete or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. In an effort to continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including without limitation information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Site or relevant tools are your sole responsibility and USD.AI shall have no liability for such decisions. Links to third-party materials (including without limitation websites) may be provided as a convenience but are not controlled by any entity. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any aspect of the information, content, or services contained in any third-party materials or on any third-party sites accessible or linked to the Service or available via other relevant tools.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall USD.AI, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers or licensors be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Service. Under no circumstances will USD.AI be responsible for any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or use of the Service or your account or the information contained therein.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, USD.AI assumes no liability or responsibility for any (i) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (ii) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of our service; (iii) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein; (iv) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service; (v) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our service by any third party; (vi) any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Service; and/or (vii) the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party. In no event shall USD.AI, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers, or licensors be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to USD.AI hereunder or $50.00, whichever is greater.

This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if USD.AI has been advised of the possibility of such damage.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. These Terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under these Terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

## 8. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver

### 8.1 Governing Law
You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in Delaware; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Delaware. These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 8.2 and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Delaware is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

### 8.2 Arbitration
Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from USD.AI. This Section 8.2 (the “Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and USD.AI that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with USD.AI, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to these Terms.

If you are a new USD.AI user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing USD.AI at hello@permianlabs.xyz with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.

For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at hello@permianlabs.xyz and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that USD.AI has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “Rules”), except as provided herein.  In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.  AAA may be contacted at www.adr.org, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or Delaware, unless you and USD.AI agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (a) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (b) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (c) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and USD.AI agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.

Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing USD.AI from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.

If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.  All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

### 8.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Service for personal, commercial or other purposes, all Claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s Claims. you and USD.AI agree that the arbitrator may award relief only to an individual claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief on your individual claim(s). Any relief awarded may not affect other USD.AI users. You and USD.AI further agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and USD.AI are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to bring, join, or participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind as a plaintiff or class member.

## 9. General

### 9.1 Assignment
These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by USD.AI without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

### 9.2 Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms
USD.AI may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our Site, as determined by USD.AI in our sole discretion. USD.AI reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in these Terms. USD.AI is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. USD.AI may, in its sole discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the top of this page and notify you that material changes have been made to these Terms. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.

### 9.3 Entire Agreement/Severability
These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with USD.AI in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and USD.AI concerning the Service. Except as otherwise stated in Section 8.2, if any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.

### 9.4 No Waiver
No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and USD.AI’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
